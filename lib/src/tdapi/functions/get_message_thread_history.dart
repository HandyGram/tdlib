/// **GetMessageThreadHistory** *(getMessageThreadHistory)* - TDLib function
///
/// Returns messages in a message thread of a message. Can be used only if messageProperties.can_get_message_thread == true. Message thread of a channel message is in the channel's linked supergroup.. The messages are returned in reverse chronological order (i.e., in order of decreasing message_id). For optimal performance, the number of returned messages is chosen by TDLib.
///
/// * [chatId]: Chat identifier.
/// * [messageId]: Message identifier, which thread history needs to be returned.
/// * [fromMessageId]: Identifier of the message starting from which history must be fetched; use 0 to get results from the last message.
/// * [offset]: Specify 0 to get results from exactly the message from_message_id or a negative offset up to 99 to get additionally some newer messages.
/// * [limit]: The maximum number of messages to be returned; must be positive and can't be greater than 100. If the offset is negative, the limit must be greater than or equal to -offset.. For optimal performance, the number of returned messages is chosen by TDLib and can be smaller than the specified limit.
